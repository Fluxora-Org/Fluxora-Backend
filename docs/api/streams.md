# Streams API

## HEAD /api/streams/:id

Use `HEAD` when you only need to know whether a stream exists.
The handler performs a minimal lookup and returns headers without serialising the full stream body.

### Example

```bash
curl -I http://localhost:3000/api/streams/stream-abc123-0
```

### Typical response

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
ETag: W/"H1v3u4P2w0uFJp5TzS2xV6lWm7R9oQ0xZx2gV7fWgJ0"
Last-Modified: Mon, 01 Jan 2024 00:00:00 GMT
```

If the stream does not exist, the endpoint returns `404 Not Found`.

## GET /api/streams/:id

`GET` still returns the full stream document. If you only need existence checks, prefer `HEAD` to avoid unnecessary payload transfer.
